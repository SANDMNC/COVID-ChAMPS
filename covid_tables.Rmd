# Methods

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.


# Results

## Reproducible table section


```{r, tables, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

# This script calculates descriptive statistics and makes tables. 
# It uses the same script that was the imput for the analyses script.
# Question: Need to check with Sarah whether those numbers will be correct depending on listwise deletion??

#read in data
covid_data_child <- read.csv("covid_data_child_scored.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Things to do:
# N's/stats for the sample used in analysis (i.e., those that completed SDQ1 or PTSD, n parents is 381):
# Frequencies,% for demographic info - gender of parent and children, country, income, edu, occupation, ethnicity, biological vs other relationship to child
# Frequencies/% for COVID - tested, hospitalized, known, known hospitalized, known died, stay at home (Y/N), stay at home length, restriction lifted?, follow rules, why?, job change
# COVID total distress and COVID positive - M/SD
# COVID communication - facts/emotion/self M/SD
# Frequencies for any past/current mental illness of parent and children
# SDQ change since COVID - M/SD + frequencies based on number of items where more is reported (something to indicate the extent of kids who had worsenign problems)



#Mean, SD, range for continuous vbls - DASS Dep & Anx & Stress, FES, PARQ hostile & warmth, 
# SDQ emo, hyp, con, peer, PTSD 
# + Ns/% in each group based on clinical cut-off's (DASS, PARQ, SDQ).

#Select the variables to go in

analysis_vars<- dplyr::select(covid_data_child, DASSDep, DASSAnx, DASSStress, totalFES, PARQhostile, PARQwarmth, 
              SDQemo, SDQhyp, SDQcon, SDQpeer, totalPTSD)

#provides mean, sd, kurtosis, skew etc
desc <- describe(analysis_vars)

#Just select the columns want for table (at this point n,m,sd,range)
desc1 <- desc[, c("n", "mean", "sd", "range")]

row.names(desc1) <- c("DASS - Depression", "DASS - Anxiety", "DASS - Stress", "FES", "PARQ - Hostile", "PARQ - Warmth", 
              "SDQ - emotional problems" , "SDQ - hyperactivity", "SDQ - conduct", "SDQ - peer problems", "PTSD symptoms")

#Use the wrapper apa_table to make an apa table of the descriptive

apa_table(desc1,
          caption = "Means, standard deviations and range for the key measures",
          #note = "bottom part",
